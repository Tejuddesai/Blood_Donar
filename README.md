 The Blood Donor Management System is a web-based platform designed to facilitate blood donation by maintaining updated records of doctors and blood banks while enabling seamless communication through automated email notifications. The system allows users to register as blood donors, track donation history, and search for available blood units. Blood banks can update their stock, and doctors can manage donor eligibility. When a blood request is made, the system automatically notifies the relevant donors, doctors, or blood banks via email, ensuring a quick and efficient response to urgent medical needs
